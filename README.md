## Commands

All commands can be used in more bot-like way, that supports `?`, `!`
and `/` as the invocation character, and alternatively with a more
human readable way, with sentences that can be customized.

The comment with the command will be minimized and marked as resolved.

### Duplicate

This command will close the current issue as an duplicate.

Usage:

- **Bot-like**: `?duplicate #<issue-number>`
- **Sentence**: `Duplicate of #<issue-number>`

If the sentence way is used and the comment contains a question mark
after the issue number, the command will not be executed as a way to
preventing the current issue from being closed if the person that
commented are in doubt if the current issue is indeed a duplicate.

### Edit issue title

This command will edit the title of the current issue. The new title
must be surrounded by double quotes, and it supports escaping by using `\"`.

Usage:

- **Bot-like**: `?edit-title "<new-title>"`
- **Sentence**: `Edit title to "<new-title>"`

### Lock the issue

This command will lock the current issue.

Usage:

- **Bot-like**: `?lock`
- **Sentence**: `Lock this issue`

Alternatively, the lock reason can be specified.

Usage:

- **Bot-like**: `?lock <off-topic|too heated|resolved|spam>`
- **Sentence**: `Lock this issue as <off-topic|too heated|resolved|spam>`

## Duplicate URLs check

The action can also check for opened issues with a given label for
duplicate URLs. It's useful if you have a system to request websites
to be added to your repository through issues.

To enable it, you need to set `duplicate-check-enabled` to `true`
and define the label that the action should check with `duplicate-check-label`.

---

## Auto closer

Automatically close issues whose title or body text matches the specified regular expression pattern.

Rules are re-evaluated on issue edits and automatically reopens the issue if the rules pass.

### Rule

```js
{
  type: 'title' | 'body' | 'both';
  regex: string;
  message: string;
  ignoreCase: boolean | undefined;
}
```

- `type`: Part to run regex against.
- `regex`: String compiled to a JavaScript `RegExp`. If matched, the issue is closed.
- `message`: ES2015-style template literal evaluated with the issue webhook payload in context (see [payload example](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-15)). Posted when the issue is closed. You can use `{match}` as a placeholder to the first match.
- `ignoreCase`: Optionally make the regex case insensitive. Defaults to `false`.

Example:

```yml
auto-close-rules: |
  [
    {
      "type": "title",
      "regex": ".*Placeholder title.*",
      "message": "@${issue.user.login} this issue was automatically closed because it did not follow the issue template"
    }
  ]
```
